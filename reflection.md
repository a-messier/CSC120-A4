I really enjoyed getting to practice encapsulation in this assignment. It felt like a very natural implementation of classes in Java, and completing this assignment has given me both a greater appreciation for classes in Java, and a better understanding of how to structure everything within classes. It was difficult to think about which attributes/methods should be public or private (which I am not confident I did correctly), but I found the walk-through on setting up each class very helpful in starting off learning about encapsulation. I did not find this assignment particularly challening given how much informaion was provided on how to strucure everything, but think that it was necessary to make me feel confident in setting up class structure. I also appreciated having some freedom to test the classes and implement some parts of the train in a way I found interesting, such as setting the train's rate of fuel use as a function of its engine type. 

For someone taking this class in the future, I would reccomend writing some psuedocode for this assignment, and following the instructions linearly. The assignment is not very difficult but it is easy to get confused in how everything interacts, and which attributes/methods belond to which classes.
